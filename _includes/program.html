                    <p>The faculty in the summer school will cover a wide range of core topics related to learning and decision making in humans (and machines). Topics will include reinforcement learning, function learning and supervised learning, risk-taring and decisions from experience, social learning in the domains of truth and taste, sampling as a explanation of judgment biases.   </p>

                    <p>In addition to the main lectures we will organize hands on tutorials about methods that you can use in your own research. This will incluce a turorial on major reinforcement learning methods, a turorial on machine-learning and big-data for JDM researchers, a tutorial on function learning and categorization and a tutorial on multi-stage decision-making under cognitive limitations </p>

                    <p>During the summer schoool we will host panels with leading figures in Judgment and Decision Making research focused on topics such as career development, academic publishing and open science. We will leverage Barcelona's bustling JDM community (https://bejavioral.org/) spanning across 4 different academic institutions to connect students to other researchers in the city. </p>

                    <p>The summer school will also host two poster sessions where participants will present they research to other early career researchers and the faculty. This will be an opportunity to get feedback on your current research from a broader audience and to communicate your most recent and exciting results. </p>
